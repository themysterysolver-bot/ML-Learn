        "### Classification and Regression\n",
        " - There are two major types of supervised machine learning problems, called *classification* and *regression*.\n",
        " - In `classification`, the goal is to predict a ***class*** *label*, which is a choice from a predefined list of possibilities.\n",
        "  - Binary(yes/no)\n",
        "  - Multiclass\n",
        "\n",
        "> In `binary classification` we often speak of one class being the ***posi\n",
        "tive class*** and the other class being the ***negative class***. Here, positive\n",
        " doesn’t represent having benefit or value, but rather what the object\n",
        " of the study is. So, when looking for spam, “positive” could mean\n",
        " the spam class. Which of the two classes is called positive is often a\n",
        " subjective matter, and specific to the domain\n",
        "\n",
        "> Multiple class **Eg:lang detection**\n",
        "\n",
        "- For `regression` tasks, the goal is to predict a continuous number, or a floating-point\n",
        " number in programming terms (or real number in mathematical terms).\n",
        "---\n",
        "- An easy way to distinguish between classification and regression tasks is to ask\n",
        " whether *there is some kind of continuity* in the output. If there is continuity between\n",

        "tics as the training set that we used.\n",
        "  -  If a model is able to make accurate predictions on\n",
        " unseen data, we say it is able to ***generalize*** from the training set to the test set.\n",

        " model to also be accurate on the test set. \" However, there are some cases where this\n",
        " can go wrong \". For example, if we allow ourselves to build very complex models, we\n",
        " can always be as accurate as we like on the training set.\n",
        "- ***Overfitting***\n",
        " occurs when you fit a model too closely to the particularities of the training set and\n",
        " obtain a model that works well on the training set but is not able to generalize to new\n",
        " data.\n",
        "- Choosing\n",
        " too *simple a model* is called ***underfitting***\n",
        "\n",
        ">The more complex we allow our model to be, the better we will be able to predict on\n",
        " the training data. However, if our model becomes too complex, we start focusing too\n",
        " much on each individual data point in our training set, and the model will not gener\n",

        "\n",
        "> There is a sweet spot in between that will yield the best generalization performance.\n",

        "- Larger variety of data points your data\n",
        "set contains, the more complex a model you can use without overfitting. Usually, col\n",
        "lecting more data points will yield more variety, so larger datasets allow building\n",
